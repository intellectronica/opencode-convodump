## Git Workflow

- These rules are mandatory and must be followed diligently, without exception.
- After every change, create a commit immediately.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what was done and why.
- After each commit, run `git pull --rebase`.
- Resolve any rebase conflicts immediately, then run `git push`.
- Keep the local branch in sync with the remote branch at all times.
- Ensure the working directory is clean (all changes committed) before ending your session.
